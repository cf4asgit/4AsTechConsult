# Year in Review

## What do you consider to be the biggest accomplishment/highlight of the year for your department/group and why.

###  New Website
Getting the website re-design and reengineering project started. We have a complicated backend with some specialist technology and so finding the right partner was key. We're working now with VML, a 4A's member with relevant expereince in b2b system and design. 

Since we've got new leadership for membership, marketing/communications, and the media side of the business it's so important that we create a web tool that can be reflective and responsive to the varying needs of these groups. The 4A's is energized in new ways and we want to be able to connect in many ways.

In the mean time, I'm proud of the development team for the commitment to making important incremental changes in the functioning and design of the site and interfaces of the current site. The work is sometimes under the surface, but I think we've improved the experience steadily. And they're thinking all the time about how to make things better and not just rest on.


### CreateTech 2014
Just as big for me is CreateTech which we held in Boston this year. We're now in our 4th year and this may have been the best so far. 

Createtech is designed as a different kind of technology conference. We want a place for the professional technologists and senior managers to hear about and discuss advanced topics, that also push into the speculative and the future, especially as it applies to the creative community. There are many great technology and creative conferences out there and many go to them! 

So what we felt was missing was a place to think about how technology is contributing to individual and social change from the people with a deep perspective of knowledge or practice. And what this is likely to mean for communicators. 

The creative technologies committee, which now has 25 members from agencies all over the country, gets together in early part fo the year to discuss an over all theme. After the dramatically increased coverage of wearables and new consumer internet of things products we decided to discuss the emerging connected world. It's covered intensely now but everyone, even the large brands are feeling their way to this new world being born. There is a LOT to work out, and to determine where marketing and advertising fits in will require a lot of learning and cross discipline colaboration. 

So this year we heard from researchers in experience design, robotics and data, visulization, senior agency strategists and technologists and their client partners, digital specialists who move between the art and commercial world and even CTOs and bio hackers. All discussing their work on digital life enhancements from the intimate and personal scaling to stadiums and even cities.

It was a great conference and I hope more members will join us next year.
Stay tuned for next year! And send us your ideas.





## What is a service/product you provide that most members may not be aware of. 

### Agency Technology Management consulting.
The creative technologies committee has it's own event and the committee has steadily grown, but it may not be as well-known as it could be, and we have more experience in other aspects so of technology management that could be exploited.

We've done a bit of consulting on technology management issues with individual agencies such as the almost universal challenge of creative assets and storage, and project management. And I've given some talks about important technology trends and their importance to marketing and brand building to regional groups occasionally. I've moderated panels on at AppNation and SXSW among others etc. But we're looking to build out a more robust capability from the creative technologies foundation we have with that committee.

Sheldon Monteiro the Chief Technology Officer at SapienNitro gave a talk on the evolution of the creative technologist and how we'll need to step up the agency technology practice to move towards towards a continous delivery mentality that will align better with the clients 360 degrees always-on marketing philosophies and technology stacks. This development is still in it's beginning stages and very uneven, but we'll be looking to help agencies meet these choppy waters with more information and best practices on technology trends across business process, services and creative. Key to this effort will be a strong collaboration with the business management and media side of the house, providing a technology perspective when needed.




## Which initiative are you most looking forward to tackling. In 2015 and why. 

### Next year
The website project will be exciting and I hope also will engage the entire 4As in creating a digital destination and real utility for members. 

But I'm most looking forward to moving the conversation forward about technology and development expertise and management as a core agency capability. I think this is something that has challenge and changed agencies in the last few years and will continue to do so for clients and agencies alike. We've not seen the end of advances and turmoil in the use of data, social technology as media, and new forms of creative, distribution and measurement. Their are also major opportunities for agencies in creating  new forms of value for themselves and new services and deeper relationships with their cleints. It's an exciting time and the 4A's will be there.
